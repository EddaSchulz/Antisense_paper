# Synthetic Antisense Locus

## Description
This subfolder contains the code that was used to perform the ODE simulations of reporter kinetics for quantification of memory at the synthetic
antisense locus.
1. Files *data_xxxx.csv* contain the MFI measurements of the replicates (C1: Time, C2: GFP, C3: tdTomato)
2. Files *simulate_xxxxx.m* were used to simulate the protein kinetics for the respective condition, perform the fit and compute the profile likelihood
3. *fit_kprod_diff.m* and *model_diff.m* are used to fit the differentiation dependent production rate.
4. Files *sim_xxxxx.csv* contain the simulation output files generated by *simulate_xxxxx.m* that are then loaded by the script that generates Fig6.
