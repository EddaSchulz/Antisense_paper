# Summary of scripts used for revision simulations

1. *function_general_as_model_250301.m* and *reaction_general_AS_model_250301.cpp* were used to perform the bursting simulations.
2. *function_general_as_model_250301_mitosis.m* and *reaction_general_AS_model_250301_mitosis.cpp* were used for the mitosis simulations with promoter reactivation during mitosis.
3. *function_general_as_model_250301_mitosis_noPreact.m* and *reaction_general_AS_model_250301_mitosis_noPreact.cpp* were used for the mitosis simulations without promoter reactivation during mitosis.

The subfolders contain the parameter sets of the simulations added during the revision and the scripts that have been used to generate them.
