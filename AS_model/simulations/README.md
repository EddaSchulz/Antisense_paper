# Structure 

The subfolders contain the FST files of the full model and all model simplifications (each row is a simulated parameter set).
Structure of the files:
| Column | Content | Variable name |
|:------------|:-------------:|-------------:|
| 1:30        | parameters          |          |
| 31:33       | FST Ini1, averaged over all alleles on RNAP,RNA,Protein level | avg_fsw1        |
| 34:36       | FST Ini2, averaged over all alleles on RNAP,RNA,Protein level | avg_fsw2        |
|37	|	Mean of RNAP A distribution over last 50h and all alleles - Ini1 |	mean_pa1 |
|38	 |	Mean of RNAP A distribution over last 50h and all alleles - Ini2 |	mean_pa2 |
